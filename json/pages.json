This is why I pursued a <strong>degree in Computer Engineering</strong> at the <strong><a href=\"https://www.uab.cat/\">Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB)</a></strong>. I have completed a <strong>Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence</strong> at the <strong><a href=\"https://www.unir.net/\">University of La Rioja (UNIR)</a></strong>. I am excited to continue exploring the fascinating field of AI and apply my skills and knowledge to innovative projects.",
                        "My areas of interest and expertise include algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI), web and multi-platform application development, and game development. I am also interested in expanding my knowledge in fields such as cybersecurity and Big Data.",
                        "As a computer engineer, I am proficient in various programming languages including <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong> (including <strong>Java for Android</strong>), as well as web development languages such as <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JQuery</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>PHP</strong>. I am also experienced in implementing dynamic websites, such as e-commerce sites, using the <strong>Model-View-Controller paradigm</strong>.",
                        "In addition to programming, I have experience working with various databases, primarily relational databases such as <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>SQLite</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, as well as some experience with non-relational databases like <strong>MongoDB</strong>.",
                        "I enjoy learning from my work, and one area of particular interest to me is process automation.<br> I find it rewarding to create programs that save time, effort, and reduce mistakes by automating repetitive tasks that would otherwise be performed manually. As part of job as Systems Consultant - Source Code Reviewer, I developed various <strong>automations</strong> for <strong>file management</strong> and <strong>folder navigation</strong>, along with tools for <strong>digital signature extraction</strong>, <strong>file comparison</strong>, and <strong>automatic report generation</strong>. <br>These tools have allowed us to save a significant amount of time and effort on tasks we perform regularly, while also reducing the likelihood of errors. From a business point of view, these types of process improvements are important in order to <strong>increase efficiency</strong> and <strong>reduce costs</strong>."
