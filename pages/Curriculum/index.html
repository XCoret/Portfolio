        <h2>Trying to be PROgrammer.</h2>
        <p>This site aims to be a window to almost all my work in the IT world. Here I will publish information about my work and projects, both finished and ongoing. Obviously there also will be the links to the projects themselves in <a href="https://github.com/XCoret">my GitHub</a>.</p>

        <h2>What about me?</h2>
        <img src="img/profile.png">
        <p>My name is Xavi Coret Mayoral and I am a Computer Engineering student at the <b><a href="https://www.uab.cat/">Autonomous University of Barcelona(UAB)</a></b>. I love programming, spending hours in front of the computer trying to improve my code and looking for new challenges is what I like to do, that is why I am studying the speciality of Computing of my carreer.</p>
        <p>Among my interests and knowledge I can emphasize algorithm and artificial intelligence (AI), the development of web and multi-platform applications and also the game development. I would also like to know more about fields of knowledge such as cybersecurity and, of course, Big Data.</p>
        <p>As a computer engineering student, I can say that I am familiar with different programming languages, such as: <b>C</b>,<b>C++</b> and <b>C#</b>; <b>Python</b>; <b>Java</b>, also for native <b>Android</b> so I also know <b>XML</b>; and those related to web development, that is, <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, <b>JQuery</b>, <b>JavaScript</b> and <b>PHP</b>. In these last group I have to say that, for the implementation of dynamic websites as could be an e-commerce, I also know how the <b>Model-View-Controller</b> paradigm works.</p>
        <p>I also have knowledge about databases, mainly relational (<b>SQL</b>, <b>SQLite</b> and <b>PostgreSQL</b>) but in some cases I have also worked with non-relational databases such as <b>MongoDB</b>.</p>

        <p>Here you can see my projects. I will try to get it up to date.</p>

            <h4><a href="#">Salesman</a><img class="language-icon" src="img/cpplogo.png" alt="C++" title="C++"></h4>
            <p>One of the subjects I have studied is "Analysis and Design of Algorithms." In this subject we studied the "Traveler Salesman Problem" and we designed and applied different algorithms to find the optimum path between two cities having to visit other cities in the middle.</p>

            <h4><a href="#">IGV Project</a><img class="language-icon" src="img/cpplogo.png" alt="C++" title="C++"></h4>
            <p>In "Interactive Graphic Viewing" subject I had a first contact with 3D objects and openGL. I applied knowledge about perspective, lighting and transformation and animation of objects, in both 2D and 3D. I also developed a landscape representation through vectors.</p>

            <p>One of my hobbies is to implement casual games by using the Phaser framework for JavaScript. Here you can see and play some of them.</p>
