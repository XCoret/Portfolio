Hello everyone!

I'm excited to share my professional portfolio and curriculum with you. This website is a space where you can learn more about me, my skills, and my experience.


## About me

[![Xavi Coret Mayoral](img/profile.png "Xavi Coret Mayoral")](https://www.freepik.es/vector-gratis/medida-proteccion-distanciamiento-social_7534262.htm#page=4&query=social%20distancing&position=27&from_view=search&track=ais)

My name is Xavi Coret Mayoral and I am a computer engineer.
I am passionate about programming and love spending hours in front of my computer, constantly improving my code and taking on new challenges. This is why I pursued a degree in Computer Engineering at the Autonomous University of Barcelona(UAB).

My areas of interest and expertise include algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI), web and multi-platform application development, and game development. I am also interested in expanding my knowledge in fields such as cybersecurity and Big Data.

As a computer engineer, I am proficient in various programming languages including

![C++](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%2B%2B-blue?logo=C%2B%2B), 
![C#](https://img.shields.io/badge/C%23-blue?logo=C%20Sharp), 
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-yellow?logo=Python), 
![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-red?logo=Java&logoColor=white&color=%23e01e23) (including Java for Android), as well as web development languages such as 
![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-orange?logo=HTML5), 
![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-blue?logo=CSS3), 
![JQuery](https://img.shields.io/badge/jQuery-blue?logo=jQuery), 
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-black?logo=JavaScript) and ![PHP](https://img.shields.io/badge/PHP-purple?logo=PHP). I am also experienced in implementing dynamic websites, such as e-commerce sites, using the Model-View-Controller paradigm.

In addition to programming, I have experience working with various databases, primarily relational databases such as ![SQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQL-white?logo=MySQL), ![SQLite](https://img.shields.io/badge/SQLite-blue?logo=SQLite) and ![PostgreSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/PostgreSQL-blue?logo=PostgreSQL), as well as some experience with non-relational databases like ![MongoDB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MongoDB-green?logo=MongoDB).

I enjoy learning from my work, and one area of particular interest to me is process automation.
I find it rewarding to create programs that save time, effort, and reduce mistakes by automating repetitive tasks that would otherwise be performed manually. As part of job as Systems Consultant - Source Code Reviewer, I developed various automations for file management and folder navigation, along with tools for digital signature extraction, file comparison, and automatic report generation.
These tools have allowed us to save a significant amount of time and effort on tasks we perform regularly, while also reducing the likelihood of errors. From a business point of view, I believe that these types of process improvements are important in order to increase efficiency and reduce costs.
