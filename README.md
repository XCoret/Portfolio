## Achievements
I enjoy learning from my work, and one area of particular interest to me is process automation.
I find it rewarding to create programs that save time, effort, and reduce mistakes by automating repetitive tasks that would otherwise be performed manually. 

As part of job as _Systems Consultant - Source Code Reviewer at BMM Testlabs_, I developed various **automations** for **file management** and **folder navigation**, along with tools for **digital signature extraction**, **file comparison**, and **automatic report generation**.
These tools have allowed us to save a significant amount of time and effort on tasks we perform regularly, while also reducing the likelihood of errors. From a business point of view, these types of process improvements are important in order to **increase efficiency** and **reduce costs**.

In my job as a Frontline TSR  - Big Data specialist in Google Cloud Platform at Webhelp, I had the opportunity to become an Associate Cloud Engineer certified by Google Cloud.
