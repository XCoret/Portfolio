        <h2>Trying to be PROgrammer.</h2>
        <p>My goal is to make this site a window into my IT career. You'll find information about my work and projects, both finished and in progress. There will also be links to the projects in <a href="https://github.com/XCoret">my GitHub</a>.</p>

        <h2>What about me?</h2>
        <img src="img/profile2022.png">
        <p> My name is Xavi Coret Mayoral and I am a Computer Engineer.</br>I love programming. Spending hours in front of the computer trying to improve my code and looking for new challenges is what I like to do. This is why I studied Computer Engineering at the <strong><a href="https://www.uab.cat/">Autonomous University of Barcelona(UAB)</a></strong>.</p>
        <p>My areas of interest and knowledge include algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI), web and multi-platform application development, as well as game development. I would also like to know more about fields of knowledge such as cybersecurity and, of course, Big Data.</p>
        <p>As a computer engineering student, I can say that I am familiar with different programming languages, such as: <strong>C</strong>,<strong>C++</strong> and <strong>C#</strong>; <strong>Python</strong>; <strong>Java</strong>, also for native <strong>Android</strong> so I also know <strong>XML</strong>; and those related to web development, that is, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JQuery</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>PHP</strong>. In these last group I have to say that, for the implementation of dynamic websites as could be an e-commerce, I also know how the <strong>Model-View-Controller</strong> paradigm works.</p>
        <p>I also have knowledge about databases, mainly relational (<strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>SQLite</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>) but in some cases I have also worked with non-relational databases such as <strong>MongoDB</strong>.</p>
        <p>I learn a lot from my work. One thing that has become a hobby of mine is process automation. I love creating programs that save me time that I would spend doing tasks manually.<br>In my current job I have developed different <strong>automations</strong> for <strong>file management</strong> and <strong>folder navigation</strong>, as well as tools for <strong>digital signature extraction</strong>, <strong>file comparison</strong> and <strong>automatic report generation</strong> that have allowed to <strong>save time</strong> and <strong>reduce the mistakes</strong> made on tasks that we do every day.</p>

        <h2>Portfolio</h2>
        <p>Here you can see my projects. I will try to get it up to date.</p>
        <ul>

            <h4><a href="#" onclick="UnavailableAlert()">Salesman</a><img class="language-icon" src="img/cpplogo.png" alt="C++" title="C++"></h4>
            <p>One of the subjects I have studied is "Analysis and Design of Algorithms." In this subject we studied the "Traveler Salesman Problem" and we designed and applied different algorithms to find the optimum path between two cities having to visit other cities in the middle.</p>

            <h4><a href="#" onclick="UnavailableAlert()">IGV Project</a><img class="language-icon" src="img/cpplogo.png" alt="C++" title="C++"></h4>
            <p>In "Interactive Graphic Viewing" subject I had a first contact with 3D objects and openGL. I applied knowledge about perspective, lighting and transformation and animation of objects, in both 2D and 3D. I also developed a landscape representation through vectors.</p>

            <p>One of my hobbies is to implement casual games by using the Phaser framework for JavaScript. Here you can see and play some of them.</p>

            <p>Due to the coronavirus outbreak, three colleagues and I participated in a Hackathon in the subject of Multimedia
            Systems. Our app used Google Cloud technologies to measure distance between pedestrians.</p>
