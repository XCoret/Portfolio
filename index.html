        <h2>Efficient programming, effortless solutions.</h2>
        <p>I'm excited to share my professional portfolio and curriculum with you. This website is a space where you can learn more about me, my skills, and my experience.</p>

        <h2>What about me?</h2>
        <img src="img/profile.png">
        <p>My name is Xavi Coret Mayoral and I am a computer engineer.<br> I am passionate about programming and love spending hours in front of my computer, constantly improving my code and taking on new challenges. This is why I pursued a degree in Computer Engineering at the <strong><a href="https://www.uab.cat/">Autonomous University of Barcelona(UAB)</a></strong>.</p>
        <p>My areas of interest and expertise include algorithms, artificial intelligence (AI), web and multi-platform application development, and game development. I am also interested in expanding my knowledge in fields such as cybersecurity and Big Data.</p>  
        <p>As a computer engineer, I am proficient in various programming languages including <strong>C</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Java</strong> (including <strong>Java for Android</strong>), as well as web development languages such as <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, <strong>JQuery</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>PHP</strong>. I am also experienced in implementing dynamic websites, such as e-commerce sites, using the <strong>Model-View-Controller paradigm</strong>.</p>
        <p>In addition to programming, I have experience working with various databases, primarily relational databases such as <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>SQLite</strong> and <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, as well as some experience with non-relational databases like <strong>MongoDB</strong>.</p>
        <p>I enjoy learning from my work, and one area of particular interest to me is process automation.<br> I find it rewarding to create programs that save time, effort, and reduce mistakes by automating repetitive tasks that would otherwise be performed manually. As part of job as Systems Consultant - Source Code Reviewer, I developed various <strong>automations</strong> for <strong>file management</strong> and <strong>folder navigation</strong>, along with tools for <strong>digital signature extraction</strong>, <strong>file comparison</strong>, and <strong>automatic report generation</strong>. <br>These tools have allowed us to save a significant amount of time and effort on tasks we perform regularly, while also reducing the likelihood of errors. From a business point of view, I believe that these types of process improvements are important in order to <strong>increase efficiency</strong> and <strong>reduce costs</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Portfolio</h2>
        <p>This section showcases some of the projects that I've worked on throughout my career. These projects have been instrumental in developing my skills and expertise, and I'm excited to share them with you.</p>

            <h4><a href="#" onclick="UnavailableAlert()">TSP - Salesman Problem</a><img class="language-icon" src="img/cpplogo.png" alt="C++" title="C++"></h4>
            <p>One of the subjects I have studied is Analysis and Design of Algorithms. In this subject, we studied the "Traveling Salesman Problem," designed and applied different algorithms to find the optimal path between two cities, while having to visit other cities in between.</p>

            <h4><a href="#" onclick="UnavailableAlert()">IGV Project</a><img class="language-icon" src="img/cpplogo.png" alt="C++" title="C++"></h4>
            <p> In the "Interactive Graphic Viewing" subject, I had my first contact with 3D objects and OpenGL. I applied knowledge about perspective, lighting, transformation, and animation of objects in both 2D and 3D. I also developed a landscape representation using vectors.</p>

            <p>For my final degree project, I developed an application that could detect, recognize, and provide information about traffic signs in real-time. I implemented convolutional neural networks and computer vision in this project. As a result, computer vision has become one of my favorite fields of study.</p>
