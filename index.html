            <p>One of the subjects I have studied is "Analysis and Design of Algorithms." In this subject we studied the "Traveler Salesman Problem" and we designed and applied different algorithms to find the optimum path between two cities having to visit other cities in the middle.</p>

            <p>In "Interactive Graphic Viewing" subject I had a first contact with 3D objects and openGL. I applied knowledge about perspective, lighting and transformation and animation of objects, in both 2D and 3D. I also developed a landscape representation through vectors.</p>
